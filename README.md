# TinyTorch

**TinyTorch** is a lightweight, educational deep learning framework inspired by PyTorch.  
It is built from scratch to demonstrate how modern deep learning systems work internally.

TinyTorch focuses on:
- Tensor operations and automatic differentiation
- Core neural network components
- Training pipelines without hidden abstractions
- Mathematical clarity and reproducibility

All modules are accessible via the `tinytorch.core.*` namespace.
